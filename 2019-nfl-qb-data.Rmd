# Our question


Passer rating is a metric used to evaluate quarterbacks in the NFL, and it is calculated based on a quarterbackâ€™s completions, yards gained, touchdowns, interceptions and attempts.

When using metrics to evaluate players or teams, it is important to determine whether these metrics are valid measures of performance. In this case, we need to determine if passer rating is a good measure of success. So, our question becomes:

How does passer rating relate to success?

We can use the number of wins (wins) a team has when a particular quarterback starts as a measure of success. And then the questions we are trying to answer now are:

- Do quartbacks with a higher passer rating have more wins?

- Do quarterbacks with a lower passer rating have fewer wins?

- How many wins can we expect to get when we have a starting quarterback with a particular passer rating?
